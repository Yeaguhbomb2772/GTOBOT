Your team's stats may change depending on how you build it.
Every card has a base stat that is calculated by popularity, animes and mangas they are in.
Do !card <name of character> to see their base stats.

There are a couple of ways to buff your deck's stats and here are the rules:
There are no buffs/benefits of using a team less than 4 cards.

Note: These set effects stack!
1. If you have 4 cards from the same anime, you get a significant buff to all stats.
2. If you have all 4 cards from different animes, the strongest member gets nerfed while the weakest member gets buffed.
3. If you have mixmatched animes, the strongest member gets a significant nerf it it's stats.
    
4. If all of the card's in your deck's damage are within 2k range of each other then every card gets a significant buff.
5. If all of the card's in your deck's damage are within 5k range of each other then every card gets a slight.
6. If all of the card's in your deck's damage are within 20k range of each other then every card gets a slight nerf.
    
7. If all of the card's in your deck has 6 speed every card gets a significant damage buff.
8. If all of the card's in your deck has 2 or less speed every card gets a significant health buff.
9. If all of the card's in your deck has less than 1k damage every card gets 25k+ stats.
10. If all of the card's in your deck has the same first name OR last name, every card gains 50L stats
    
11. If the total favorite score of the deck is less than 50k buff every card
12. If the total favorite score of the deck is more than 200k debuff every card
13. If their manga or animes they are from match they are buffed
